# CapOwn

Multi-host remote operation and AI Agent coordination system. A central Master node manages and dispatches tasks to multiple Worker nodes over HTTPS + SSE, enabling cross-network execution without requiring inbound ports on worker machines.

## Architecture

```
[Client / Agent]
    | (HTTPS POST: dispatch tasks)
    v
[Master (public IP) -- central router]
    ^ (HTTPS POST: report results)
    | (SSE long-poll: push task instructions)
    |
    +-- [Worker @ Node A]
    +-- [Worker @ Node B]
    +-- [Worker @ Node C]
    ...
```

### Design Constraints

- **All-outbound connections**: Workers only need outbound HTTPS. No inbound ports required.
- **Central routing hub**: All inter-node communication routes through Master.
- **Capability/intelligence split**: Workers provide execution; Agents provide LLM decisions.
- **Dual deployment modes**: Workers support container (Docker) and host (native) deployment. Container mode bind-mounts a selected host directory as the worker workspace; host mode runs commands directly on the host system.

### Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **Master** | Node registry, SSE broker, task router, auth gateway |
| **Worker** | Lightweight daemon that connects to Master, executes tasks, reports results |
| **Client** | CLI tool or SDK to dispatch tasks to Master |

## Quick Deploy

```bash
cd CapOwn/
python3 deploy.py
```

The deploy script is entirely menu-driven. It guides you through Master, Worker, or both. See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) for the full deployment guide including Nginx setup, build flags, mirror configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Use

```bash
# List registered workers
python client/capown_client.py nodes

# Run a shell command on a worker
python client/capown_client.py run worker-1 "uname -a"
```

See [docs/user_guide.md](docs/user_guide.md) for the full user guide including configuration reference, all CLI commands, direct API usage, error codes, and capability vocabulary.
